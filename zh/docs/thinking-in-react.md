在我看来，React是较早使用JavaScript构建大型、快速的Web应用程序的技术方案。它已经被我们广泛应用于Facebook和Instagram。

React众多优秀特征中的其中一部分就是，教会你去重新思考如何构建应用程序。

本文中，我将跟你一起使用 React 构建一个具备搜索功能的产品列表。

## 从原型（mock）开始

假设我们已经拥有了一个JSON API和设计师设计的原型。我们的设计师显然不够好，因为原型看起来像这个样子：

![Mockup](/react/img/blog/thinking-in-react-mock.png)

我们的JSON API返回的数据像这样：

```
[
  {category: "Sporting Goods", price: "$49.99", stocked: true, name: "Football"},
  {category: "Sporting Goods", price: "$9.99", stocked: true, name: "Baseball"},
  {category: "Sporting Goods", price: "$29.99", stocked: false, name: "Basketball"},
  {category: "Electronics", price: "$99.99", stocked: true, name: "iPod Touch"},
  {category: "Electronics", price: "$399.99", stocked: false, name: "iPhone 5"},
  {category: "Electronics", price: "$199.99", stocked: true, name: "Nexus 7"}
];
```

## 第一步：拆分用户界面为一个组件树

你要做的第一件事是，为所有组件（及子组件）命名并画上线框图。假如你和设计师一起工作，也许他们已经完成了这项工作，所以赶紧去跟他们沟通！他们的Photoshop图层名也许最终可以直接用于你的 React组件名。

然而你如何知道哪些才能成为组件？想象一下，当你创建一些函数或对象时，用到一些类似的技术。其中一项技术就是[单一功能原则](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle)，也就是说，理想状态下一个组件应该只做一件事，假如它功能逐渐变大就需要被拆分成更小的子组件。

由于你经常需要将一个JSON数据模型展示给用户，因此你需要检查这个模型结构是否正确以便你的UI（在这里指组件结构）能够正确的映射到这个模型上。这是因为用户界面和数据模型在*信息构造* 方面都要一致，这意味着可以帮你省下很多把UI分割成组件的麻烦事。你需要做的仅仅只是将数据模型分隔成一小块一小块的组件，以便它们每个都能确切地表示你数据模型的某一方面。

你将会看见我们的简单应用中包含五个组件。我已经用斜体标识了每一个组件对应的数据。

  1. **`FilterableProductTable` （橘色）：** 包含例子中的所有组件
  2. **`SearchBar` （蓝色）：** 接受所有*用户输入*
  3. **`ProductTable` （绿色）：** 根据*用户输入*过滤和展示*数据集合*
  4. **`ProductCategoryRow` （青色）：** 为每个 *分类(category)* 展示一列表头
  5. **`ProductRow` （红色）：** 为每个*产品* 展示一列

如果你仔细观察`ProductTable`，你会发现表头（包含“Name”和“Price”标签）并不是单独的组件。
If you look at `ProductTable` you'll see that the table header (containing the "Name" and "Price" labels) isn't its own component. This is a matter of preference and there's an argument to be made either way. For this example I left it as part of `ProductTable` because it is part of rendering the *data collection* which is `ProductTable`'s responsibility. However if this header grows to be complex (i.e. if we were to add affordances for sorting) it would certainly make sense to make this its own `ProductTableHeader` component.

Now that we've identified the components in our mock, let's arrange them into a hierarchy. This is easy. Components that appear within another component in the mock should appear as a child in the hierarchy:

  * `FilterableProductTable`
    * `SearchBar`
    * `ProductTable`
      * `ProductCategoryRow`
      * `ProductRow`

## Step 2: Build a static version in React

Now that you have your component hierarchy it's time to start implementing your app. The easiest way is to build a version that takes your data model and renders the UI but has no interactivity. It's easiest to decouple these processes because building a static version requires a lot of typing and no thinking, and adding interactivity requires a lot of thinking and not a lot of typing. We'll see why.

To build a static version of your app that renders your data model you'll want to build components that reuse other components and pass data using *props*. *props* are a way of passing data from parent to child. If you're familiar with the concept of *state*, **don't use state at all** to build this static version. State is reserved only for interactivity, that is, data that changes over time. Since this is a static version of the app you don't need it.

You can build top-down or bottom-up. That is, you can either start with building the components higher up in the hierarchy (i.e. starting with `FilterableProductTable`) or with the ones lower in it (`ProductRow`). In simpler examples it's usually easier to go top-down and on larger projects it's easier to go bottom-up and write tests as you build.

At the end of this step you'll have a library of reusable components that render your data model. The components will only have `render()` methods since this is a static version of your app. The component at the top of the hierarchy (`FilterableProductTable`) will take your data model as a prop. If you make a change to your underlying data model and call `React.render()` again the UI will be updated. It's easy to see how your UI is updated and where to make changes since there's nothing complicated going on since React's **one-way data flow** (also called *one-way binding*) keeps everything modular, easy to reason about, and fast.

Simply refer to the [React docs](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/) if you need help executing this step.

### A brief interlude: props vs state

There are two types of "model" data in React: props and state. It's important to understand the distinction between the two; skim [the official React docs](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/interactivity-and-dynamic-uis.html) if you aren't sure what the difference is.

## Step 3: Identify the minimal (but complete) representation of UI state

To make your UI interactive you need to be able to trigger changes to your underlying data model. React makes this easy with **state**.

To build your app correctly you first need to think of the minimal set of mutable state that your app needs. The key here is DRY: *Don't Repeat Yourself*. Figure out what the absolute minimal representation of the state of your application needs to be and compute everything else you need on-demand. For example, if you're building a TODO list, just keep an array of the TODO items around; don't keep a separate state variable for the count. Instead, when you want to render the TODO count simply take the length of the TODO items array.

Think of all of the pieces of data in our example application. We have:

  * The original list of products
  * The search text the user has entered
  * The value of the checkbox
  * The filtered list of products

Let's go through each one and figure out which one is state. Simply ask three questions about each piece of data:

  1. Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn't state.
  2. Does it change over time? If not, it probably isn't state.
  3. Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it's not state.

The original list of products is passed in as props, so that's not state. The search text and the checkbox seem to be state since they change over time and can't be computed from anything. And finally, the filtered list of products isn't state because it can be computed by combining the original list of products with the search text and value of the checkbox.

So finally, our state is:

  * The search text the user has entered
  * The value of the checkbox

## Step 4: Identify where your state should live

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="http://jsfiddle.net/reactjs/zafjbw1e/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

OK, so we've identified what the minimal set of app state is. Next we need to identify which component mutates, or *owns*, this state.

Remember: React is all about one-way data flow down the component hierarchy. It may not be immediately clear which component should own what state. **This is often the most challenging part for newcomers to understand,** so follow these steps to figure it out:

For each piece of state in your application:

  * Identify every component that renders something based on that state.
  * Find a common owner component (a single component above all the components that need the state in the hierarchy).
  * Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state.
  * If you can't find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component simply for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component.

Let's run through this strategy for our application:

  * `ProductTable` needs to filter the product list based on state and `SearchBar` needs to display the search text and checked state.
  * The common owner component is `FilterableProductTable`.
  * It conceptually makes sense for the filter text and checked value to live in `FilterableProductTable`

Cool, so we've decided that our state lives in `FilterableProductTable`. First, add a `getInitialState()` method to `FilterableProductTable` that returns `{filterText: '', inStockOnly: false}` to reflect the initial state of your application. Then pass `filterText` and `inStockOnly` to `ProductTable` and `SearchBar` as a prop. Finally, use these props to filter the rows in `ProductTable` and set the values of the form fields in `SearchBar`.

You can start seeing how your application will behave: set `filterText` to `"ball"` and refresh your app. You'll see the data table is updated correctly.

## Step 5: Add inverse data flow

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="http://jsfiddle.net/reactjs/n47gckhr/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

So far we've built an app that renders correctly as a function of props and state flowing down the hierarchy. Now it's time to support data flowing the other way: the form components deep in the hierarchy need to update the state in `FilterableProductTable`.

React makes this data flow explicit to make it easy to understand how your program works, but it does require a little more typing than traditional two-way data binding. React provides an add-on called `ReactLink` to make this pattern as convenient as two-way binding, but for the purpose of this post we'll keep everything explicit.

If you try to type or check the box in the current version of the example you'll see that React ignores your input. This is intentional, as we've set the `value` prop of the `input` to always be equal to the `state` passed in from `FilterableProductTable`.

Let's think about what we want to happen. We want to make sure that whenever the user changes the form we update the state to reflect the user input. Since components should only update their own state, `FilterableProductTable` will pass a callback to `SearchBar` that will fire whenever the state should be updated. We can use the `onChange` event on the inputs to be notified of it. And the callback passed by `FilterableProductTable` will call `setState()` and the app will be updated.

Though this sounds like a lot it's really just a few lines of code. And it's really explicit how your data is flowing throughout the app.

## And that's it

Hopefully this gives you an idea of how to think about building components and applications with React. While it may be a little more typing than you're used to, remember that code is read far more than it's written, and it's extremely easy to read this modular, explicit code. As you start to build large libraries of components you'll appreciate this explicitness and modularity, and with code reuse your lines of code will start to shrink :)
